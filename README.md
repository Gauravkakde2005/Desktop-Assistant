# Desktop Assistant

## Introduction
The **Desktop Assistant** is a voice-controlled AI assistant built using **Python** and **Flask**. It allows users to perform various tasks using voice commands, including searching on Google, playing YouTube videos, fetching weather updates, opening applications, and more. The assistant uses **Speech Recognition** to process voice commands and responds using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts voice input into text using `speech_recognition`.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Uses `pyttsx3` to provide voice responses.
- **Google Search & YouTube Playback**: Searches the web and plays YouTube videos.
- **Wikipedia Summaries**: Fetches brief summaries of topics from Wikipedia.
- **Weather Updates**: Provides real-time weather updates using the OpenWeather API.
- **Time & Date Retrieval**: Tells the current time and date.
- **Application Launcher**: Opens Notepad and Calculator.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A simple web UI to interact with the assistant.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core language)
- **Flask** (Web framework)
- **SpeechRecognition** (For voice input processing)
- **pyttsx3** (Text-to-Speech engine)
- **pywhatkit** (For YouTube and Google searches)
- **Wikipedia API** (For fetching summaries)
- **OpenWeather API** (For weather updates)
- **Web Browser Module** (For opening websites)
- **OS Module** (For launching system applications)
